## API Integration

TREMOVIES integrates with the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie data. API calls are handled via `Axios` and centralized in the `src/services/api.js` file. The main API functions include:

- `searchMovies`: Search for movies based on a query string.
- `getMovieDetails`: Fetch detailed information about a specific movie.
- `getTrendingMovies`: Retrieve a list of currently trending movies.
- `getMovieCredits`: Fetch cast and crew information for a movie.
- `getMovieVideos`: Retrieve video links (e.g., trailers) for a movie.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/desiremushimiyimana/TREMOVIES.git
   cd tremovies
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your TREMOVIES API key:

   ```env
   VITE_TREMOVIES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open <http://localhost:5173> to view the application.
